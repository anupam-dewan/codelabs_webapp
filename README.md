Project : IsCovid()

Description: Attempting to Create a  web-application that takes a chest XRay image, and uses Deep Learning to try to predict if the person has some initial effects/infections of COVID-19 so that it can be treated before his/her condition is worsened. We attempt to analyze various models, such as basic CNN and Fast AI to see which performs best and later fine tune for best accuracy results.

Background: Our background in Python and Data Science is fairly new and through this project we attempt to learn and use Machine learning and Data Science skills to do a fun project.
